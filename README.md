### Adjacent Elements Product

**Taks:**

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

**Example:**

| Input                  | Output |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| `[3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]` | `21`   |

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] array.integer inputArray

An array of integers containing at least two elements.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 10,
-1000 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 1000.

[output] integer

The largest product of adjacent elements.

### Two Num Sum

**Task:**

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**For Example:**

| Input                                 | Output   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| nums = `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, target = `9` | `[0, 1]` |

**Note:**

Make sure you are returning the _indicies_ of the values, not the values themselves.
