## PROBLEMS LIST

### Add Two Numbers

**Task:**

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**

| Input                                  | Output        | Explaination      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| nums = `(2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)` | `7 -> 0 -> 8` | `342 + 465 = 807` |

### Two Num Sum

**Task:**

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

| Input                                 | Output   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| nums = `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, target = `9` | `[0, 1]` |

**Note:**

Make sure you are returning the _indicies_ of the values, not the values themselves.

### Adjacent Elements Product

**Task:**

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

**Example:**

| Input                  | Output |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| `[3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]` | `21`   |

**Guaranteed constraints:**
2 â‰¤ inputArray.length â‰¤ 10,
-1000 â‰¤ inputArray[i] â‰¤ 1000.
